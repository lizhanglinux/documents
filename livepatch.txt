kpatch:  https://github.com/dynup/kpatch.git

kpatch is a tool to build live patching. 
The patches should be refined for live patching.
For some kernel patches, which has static_call, 
we need to replace it with KPATCH_STATIC_CALL macro for live patching. 
And some definitions in linux kernel headers, it doesn't work for live patching.
We need to add these definitions in .c files. 


kvm_x86_call(get_exit_info) -> KPATCH_STATIC_CALL(get_exit_info) ();
