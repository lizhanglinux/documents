When building kernel-6.15.2, it reports an error as the following: 

CC      kernel/jump_label.o
CC      kernel/iomem.o
CC      kernel/rseq.o
AR      kernel/built-in.a
CC      certs/system_keyring.o
make[1]: *** No rule to make target 'debian/certs/debian-uefi-certs.pem', needed by 'certs/x509_certificate_list'.  Stop.
make: *** [Makefile:1851: certs] Error 2


Solution: 
Change configuration file before building the kernel. 

scripts/config --disable SYSTEM_TRUSTED_KEYS
scripts/config --disable SYSTEM_REVOCATION_KEYS


It works well.
